Hi Everyone.

This is the first post for the new website.  Better ones to follow.

This is a static site built using Jekyll and the Libris Template(which is tied up with the Stackbit JS Rendering System).  Our site is served from GitHub with the source available in the repository.

Posts are created with a header that describes the post and then the post content is created with Markdown formatting.
