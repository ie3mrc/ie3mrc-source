### When does the club meet?

It presently meets the 4th Friday of the month at 7 pm Eastern time.

### What is going on now?

There are several activities:  moving the club to "operational" with all the governance details, communications (like a website, possibly social media, etc.) details, club call sign, club DMRID, individual members are getting set up to operate on DMR as well.  Lots of group learning and sharing is expected to be the norm.

### I live in Puerto Rico (or New Delhi, India, or San Jose, CA).  Presently MOVE does not appear to be operating here.  Should I join?  What value can I add/derive by becoming a member and participating?

Joining the club would be worthwhile for camaraderie with other IEEE hams and training in new technologies and emergency communications.  The training is valuable, independent of the MOVE truck (or its mini-MOVE spin-offs), given an interest in helping others and understanding that disasters occur everywhere.  You may also find the club's activities and members' experiences are helpful if and when you design and deploy your equipment, in whatever form it might take.  DMR and the digital modes are certainly popular everywhere, and other subjects like NVIS are universal, whether used for disaster communications or other applications.
